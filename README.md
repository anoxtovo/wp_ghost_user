# wp_ghost_user
A WordPress mu-plugin that creates a hidden ghost user, enabling secure actions and recovery access for site administrators. This user remains invisible in the admin panel but possesses full administrative capabilities. Ideal for security operations and site recovery, but should be used with caution.
